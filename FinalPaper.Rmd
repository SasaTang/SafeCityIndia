# Abstract

This paper will use geospatial sexual harassment incident data from Safecity in 
India to examine the relationship between different types of sexual harassment in 
public space. This paper looks into the relationship between five main categories 
of sexual harassment: nondirect, direct verbal, physical, stalking, and others and
asks how these behaviors relate to each other and to different spaces. Using ArcMap
and R, I produce maps and tables to analyze these relationships. 

# Introduction
Gender-based harassment and sexual assaults are an important issue which 
affects people's safety and mobility throughout the world. Post-industrial democracies have 
many laws that codify harassment and sexual assault as illegal actions, and 
these laws tend to be generally well-enforced if victims have the agency to 
accuse their attackers. Most of these laws pertain to sexual harassment in the 
work place, with varience on laws that capture sexual harassment in public spaces.
The governmentality of post-industrial democracies results in large amounts of data 
capture, and this facilitates spatial analysis of harassment and sexual assaults. 
It is less clear to what extend laws in developing states protect people from 
harassment and sexual assault, and even  less clear whether authorities in those 
developing states enforce laws of harassment and sexual assault if victims have 
enough agency to accuse their attackers.\par
Sexual harassment laws in Indian can be divided up into two different categories: 
workplace laws and penal code laws for public spaces. The POSH Act (Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal Act) of 2013 govern and protect against sexual harassment 
in the work place where the harasser is known and there is a structured relationship 
between harasser and victim. For laws governing sexual harassment 
violations in public spaces, there are four sections under the Indian Penal Code 
from 1860 that address sexual harassment:\par
1. Section 294: law addressing obscene acts or songs ''in or near any public place"\par
2. Section 326: acid attacks that lead to physical damange\par
3. Section 354: laws that address crimes that ''outrage her modesty" including: physical contact of sexual nature, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography 
against someone's will, voyeurism, stalking, and sexual assault. \par
4. Section 509: law that punishes ''word, gesture or act intended to insult the 
modesty of a woman," that intrudes upon the privacy of the person.\par 
In both categories, there is not a strong enforcement of these law, coupled with 
the social stigma against reporting sexual harassment, and psychological barriers of self blame, all contribute to the continual prevelence of sexual harassment in both 
the work place and in public spaces. This paper focuses on sexual harassment in 
public spaces because gender based restraints on mobility affect female's participation
in public life, their access to education, their economic empowerment, and 
even their political participation. So far in India, no good information exists 
which analyzes the spatial distribution of sexual assaults, 
and it seems that the government does not systematically catalogue reports of 
such incidents. To overcome this problem, Safecity has created a 
novel way to collect data on such incidents. Safecity began as a website and has
recently moved to an app for Android and iOS enabled devices, which allows 
harassment and sexual assault victims to report the exact location of their 
harassment and the characteristics of the incident. To date, it does not appear 
that a spatial analysis on public space using this Safecity data has been carried out—this is the research gap that I intend to address in this research project.\par


# Literature
## Sexual Harassment
There are three main frameworks to understand sexual harassment:  social-structural, social control, and sociocultural. Sexual harassment in the social-structural 
framework regards this behavior as “markers of passage” for women because it 
communicates the hegemonic normative rules of power that negotiates behaviors 
of conduct between genders [@kissling_street_1991]. It is used as a tool 
that demonstrates unequal power relations between males and females, 
“micro-aggressions” that intrudes into personal space without consent [@davis_planet_2004].  Furthermore, @kissling_stranger_1991, and @wise_georgie_1987 
regard sexual harassment on the street as a language of “sexual terrorism” and 
argue that one reason that sexual harassment is performed in public spaces is to 
oppress women through fear. Sexual harassment in the social control framework 
views this behavior as a tool to control populations. @ilahi_gendered_2009 studies the 
Arab society and says that Islamic doctrines believes that culturally men are 
rational and capable of self-control whereas females lack control particularly 
over sexual drives, and therefore is the male’s job to maintain social hierarchy 
over women through the control of the female body. Similarly, @amar_turning_2011 study 
of protestors in Tahrir Square, Egypt shows that the regime’s security apparatus 
hired thugs to sexually assaults female activists to produce a “sexualized state 
terror” as a result of females taking agency over their own bodies to challenge 
the “manhood” of Egypt through political action. Following the tradition of body 
politics in feminist literature, the female body in Amar’s view is symbolic of 
male control and a means to practice power dominance through sexual harassment. 
Lastly, the sociocultural framework understands sexual harassment as socially 
constructed gender roles and norms that are played out to promote violence 
against women [@fitzgerald_sexual_1993; @koss_no_1994]. Sexual harassment here is 
performed by men who need to demonstrate their masculinity. While these three 
frameworks differ in only minute ways, all three views sexual harassment a 
demonstrated behavior that indicates rules of behavior that is permissible to be performed in certain places. Rules that define behavior is one of the main 
definitions of the concept of logic of appropriateness.\par
@march_logic_2011 say logic of appropriateness “are rules that prescribe, 
more or less precisely, what is appropriate action” (p. 843). Sometimes these 
rules are tied to the notion of morality, but most importantly, these rules are 
guided by conformity and stabilized expectations. These rules vary based on their location and ambiguity. Rules that written and enforced, such as behaviors of pickpocketing, are criminalized and variation of this behavior depends on levels 
of policing among other variables. Rules that are more ambiguous such as dress 
code, body behavior, access are more flexible and easier to be challenged. @chappell_comparing_2006 studied the logic of appropriateness in institutions and argued that the 
important thing about understanding logic is the process, not necessarily the 
rules. Using a neo-institutional framework, Chappell argued that the “gendering 
process” of institutions shape political opportunity structures for change. This
logic of appropriateness can be applied to this research paper by connecting the 
behavior of sexual harassment and the location of public spaces. This leads to 
the question is there a spatial relationship between the type of sexual harassment
and the place and locality it occurs? Are some areas more or less appropriate for
certain behaviors of sexual harassment more than other areas? Are certain types
of sexual harassment more prevalent in one type of space over another?\par

## Space and Place
As previously stated in the concept of logics of appropriateness, there are both 
written and unwritten rule that determine behavior within certain places. How do 
these rules vary?  @sack_human_1986 in his seminal piece _Human Territory_ talks about 
the theory of territoriality, conceptualized in terms social construction of human interaction. He says that territoriality is a tool that used “to affect, 
influence, or control actions, interaction, or access by asserting and attempting 
to enforce control over specific geographic area” (1983, p. 55). Territoriality 
establishes differential access to resources, dividing groups and thus asserting 
control. Sack highlights two ways which the dominant group can create this power: 
physical contact or domination over specific space. Applying this to the behavior 
of sexual harassment, Sack would see that physical touch or assault indicates to 
the victim that he/she is within the territory of the dominate group and such 
physical contact is within the privilege of the dominant group to exert. The 
second side of this coin is when the dominate group, in this case the hegemonic 
male group, restricts access for the other group through information dissemination.  
This paper argues that this second type of method has to do with logics of 
appropriateness within public space. Imagines or presence of male bodies, masculine 
behaviors that indicate entitlement and ownership to certain spaces product this 
domination over the public space in the form of sexual harassment.\par
Therefore, this paper asks, what types of sexual harassment behavior, or tools of territoriality play out in different spaces? Do these different tools have any relationship with each other? If a space already experiences the presense of one type of harassment,
is it more likely to influence other types of sexual harassment? How are these acts
influence each other? This paper will attempt to use spatial analysis and time series
regression analysis to answer these questions. 

# Methodology
This paper uses data from Safecity, a platform that crowdsources personal stories
of sexual harassment and abuse in public spaces. Safecity is a small nonprofit
formed in Decemeber 2012. The data collected are anonymous
and are mapped out to provide more awareness to the issue of sexual harassment
in public spaces, as well as to inform intervention methods. This paper uses
R to tidy and wrange the data and ArcGIS to map incidents. \par
In November 2017, Safecity then launched an app for iOS and Android enabled platforms 
in hopes that the use of GPS data sourced from smartphones can increase the dataset’s 
spatial accuracy as well as accessibility. The most recent observation for this paper 
ends at Feburary 22, 2018 so the effects of an app based platform is still undetermined.
Safecity relies on victim reporting as the sole source of data collection for its database currently; victim reports are textual in nature and geocoded with GPS information, 
meaning that the victim submits a written description of a harassment incident with 
as much or as little information as they deem necessary. Safecity developers then 
code these written victim accounts and add them to the database. Therefore, due to the augmentation of data between the victim’s report and the final dataset, the Safecity 
database is considered a secondary data source. It should be noted here that secondary 
sources should be treated as such-- there is no way to verify that the programmer 
coding was appropriate for what the victim described. Furthermore, 
there is no way to determine the level of intercoder reliability between programmers tasked with coding victim reports.\par 
There are a couple data considerations to address. First, while there are empirical 
limitations of crowd-sourced data since it not collected in a systematic manner,
it is still a powerful source of information; this is especially true of a country
with low levels of crime reporting and governmental statistical reporting. Second, 
it is impossible to determine whether the Safecity database suffers from collection 
bias. Bias could come be based on differential socio-economic access to smartphones, 
computers, internet, and the demographics of people reporting the incidents. The 
Caste system of India could preclude certain segments of the population from 
reporting sexual harassment incidents. Cultural norms could depress reporting of 
sexual harassment. Culture could also affect the concept of sexual harassment as 
conceived of in post-industrial Western democracies, and the concept may not have 
an exact analog within the totality of India. Education rates among 
different segments of the population could also play a role-- education could 
teach females that sexual harassment is a crime that should not be tolerated. 
While there are 22 national languages in India, Safecity is avaliable only in three: English, Hindi, and Spanish. With these considerations in mind, the analysis of this data 
is still warranted as there is a lack of focus on addressing sexual harassment in 
India. This research paper is not intended to be definitive but, instead, is 
intended to shed light on any patterns in sexual harassment incidents within India. 
This preliminary analysis  will highlight areas within India that appear to have 
problematic, non-random, spatial distributions of incidents. These highlighted areas 
would then be primed for a systematic research project or focused intervention 
designed to lower the number of harassment incidents and reduce non-random patterns of harassment and sexual assault.\par

# Tidying Data
Safecity neither maintains a codebook for their data nor does Safecity include 
metadata in their database, which made understanding and working with their dataset challenging. This dearth of information on the dataset made it necessary to 
communication with the developers of Safecity to clarify the meaning of the data 
before it could be used for this research. The full Safecity dataset contains 
7,572 observations collected between March 5, 1990 to February 22, 2018. Safecity 
maintains data for the period between 1992-2012, which is prior to the NGO’s founding 
in 2012; this pre-Safecity data was collected from secondary sources like old newspaper articles and it is unclear how reliable this data is. After removing all incidents 
that 1) were located outside of India, 2) did not have geospatial coordinates, and/or 3) occurred prior to 2013 (pre-2013 data was not crowd-sourced and source information is unknown), our modified dataset contains 5,360 observations collected between the 
2013 and 2018. The reduction in observations was necessary for several reasons.

```{r, message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
scdf <- readr::read_csv("safecity.csv")
table1 <- ggplot(scdf, aes(YEAR))
table1 + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Figure 1. Incident Report Frequency by Year", x = "Year", y = "Incident count")
```
The first task completed was to acquire information from Safecity’s developers in India regarding the dataset’s coding logic to ensure that we fully understand the data. 
The second task was to remove data points that were invalid; many of these invalid 
data points turned out to be test points which Safecity added to the dataset but 
failed to remove. This task led to the exclusion of 41 data points which were 
either 1) located outside of India’s boundaries, 2) plotted as tests by Safecity 
developers, or 3) reported as occurring in neighboring countries (Nepal specifically).
The third task involved deciding what types of harassment should be included to 
answer our research questions. The dataset contains 1907 observations that happened on a transit system (taxi, car, train, bus, metro, auto, rail, airport, travel.) Differentiation between non-transit and transit related sexual harassment incidents resulted in 
the exclusion of non-transit data because the geocoordinates of incidents which 
occurred in a closed transit system have a different spatial meaning than incidents 
which occurred on the street. Of eleven types of sexual harassment included within the dataset,I removed the category of _chain snatching_ because it is not a form of sexual harassment as defined in this research paper. _Chain snatching_, as explained by the developers of Safecity were included in the dataset because it is a common petty 
crime that people were using the platform to report. \par
The fourth task was to determine the best way to analyze the types of sexual 
harassment in the Safecity database. The Safecity database contains eleven 
different sexual harassment types and offers a nuanced account of harassment in India. However, some of the harassment types in the database are very similar in character 
and would complicate the use of mapping techniques and spatial analysis. Inductive 
methods are commonly used in qualitative research and prove a powerful strategy 
for generating typologies and theories during the research process (George & Bennett, 2005). Inductive categorization was used to overcome the dataset’s nuance problem. Then, 
the eleven sexual harassment types were effectively collapsed into larger and 
more manageable categories based on the spatial relation between the harasser 
and victim. \par
The inductive process was iterative and resulted in the generation of five broad 
harassment categories: 1) _non-interactive harassment_, 2) _direct-verbal harassment_, 
3) _direct-physical harassment_, 4) _stalking_, and 5) _other_. These broad 
categories are explained below. It should be noted that the categories are not exclusive, meaning that one harassment incident could be coded as more than one sexual harassment 
type. \par
The _Non-Interactive_ Harassment category includes 1) _indecent exposure_, 2) _staring_, 
and 3) _taking pictures_. This grouping was chosen due to the non-interactive nature 
of these types of sexual harassment between the harasser and the victim. These 
behaviors may not be directed at the specific victim but still violate people’s 
body boundaries. The spatial aspect of this category of sexual harassment is considered distant since we assume that harassers do not have to be in close proximity to the 
victim. \par
The _Direct-Verbal_ Harassment category includes 1) _catcalls_, 2) _comments_, and 
3) _sexual invites_. This grouping was chosen due to the direct and purposive behavior 
of the harasser towards the victim. The spatial aspect of this category of sexual 
harassment is considered to be proximate since I assume that a victim must have 
been in close proximity to the harasser to hear their speech.\par
The _Direct-Physical_ Harassment includes 1) _touch_ and 2) _sexual assault_. This 
grouping was chosen due to the direct violation of body boundaries. These behaviors 
are direct, physical, and often violent in nature. The spatial aspect of this 
category is considered to be proximate because I assume a harasser must be close 
enough to physically violate a victim. \par
_Stalking_ comprises its own category because this form of sexual harassment could be spatially proximate or distant depending on the specific occurrence. Furthermore, 
stalking could be a transient activity and that the reported location of stalking 
incidents could have a different meaning than the other incident types since the 
location where a stalking incident was reported could have been one of many locations 
where this episodic incident-type took place between one victim and harasser. In 
this case, the location recorded could be where the victim first become suspicious 
that they were being followed, where they realized they were being followed, or 
something else. It is impossible to tell since this information is absent from the Safecity dataset. According to India's penal codes, the law defining stalking states ''any 
man who follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster 
personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such 
woman." This law is punishable up to five years imprisonment and covers electronic
communication. Finally, The _Other_ category was left as is because of the indeterminacy of the incident type. There were 281 sexual harassment incidents that were reported and categorized as _other_ and nothing else. \par

![Map 1. All Incidents in India](cropall.png){width=70%}\par

To focus in on the spatial relation between sexual harassment types, I have decided
to zoom into focus only on New Delhi, where there are the most incident points, 
a total of 3165 observations. \par
![Map 2. All Incidents in New Delhi](allDelhi.png){width=80%}\par
Map 2 shows the spatial distribution of different types of sexual harassment layered
on top of administrative boundaries and roads. \par
First, looking at Map 2, there seems to be some clusters. So using a kmeans cluster
algorithm, I have plotted the same incident points grouped into centroids. This is 
a iterated process where the centroid of each cluster is calculated by calcluating
the closest observation in terms of Euclidian distance to the within group mean 
until the cluster assignments no longer change [@imai_quantitative_2017].

```

```{r, message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
table(catagory = gincidents$catagory, cluster =testcluster1$cluster )
```
The output of this table shows the number of incident counts according to the
cluster that they belong. It seems like cluster two has the lowest count incidents
of all the categories but it is unclear where the clusters are. \par
To advance the clustering analysis further, I would like to see the probability 
density of each individual type of  sexual harassment. I used the kernel density 
estimate which averages the probability
distribution centered around each observation point [@brunsdon_introduction_2015].

Plotting the kernel density of the different sexual harassment categories is a 
comparison tool. In all the maps I have layered the roads, the administrative
boundary of Delhi the subdistrict, of which New Delhi the captial is more spread
out than the administrative boundary, and the Yamuna river. There is a pattern
that in all sexual harassment follow a similar clustering layout in that they overlap
the most condense roads. The kernel density of _Stalking_ is most spread out, and
this makes logical sense given the fact that stalking is a more transient behavior
than the other types of harassment. There is visible variation between _Physical_
and _Direct Verbal_ and _Non-Interactive_ in that _Physical_ harassment is more
concentrated in one area close to the Yamuna river. The _Direct Verbal_ and 
_Non-Interactive_ kernel density maps look very similiar to each other, with 
_Non-Interactive_ being a bit more spread out than the _Direct Verbal_. This also 
makes more sense because as I have explained in the recategorization of the original
categories of sexual harassment, that I have conceptualized types of sexual harassment
to its spatial relation between the harasser and victim. Therefore, the prevalence
of certain types of sexual harassment is more wide spreading and covers more area 
than others. Though, it is also interesting to note that there is not a lot of 
difference between _Physical_ and _Direct Verbal_ in their kernel density maps.\par 

# Times series regression
In order to explore how different types of sexual harassment interact with each
other, and to answer the questions of the role of logic of appropriateness among
different spaces, I will conduct a spatial time series regression analysis. First,
I will create quadrants to overlay on top of the areas, and then join the incidents
into the polygon quadrants to get a count data for each quadrant. The units of my
analysis are each quadrant, with a count data for the different types of incidents
within each quadrant. My model is the following:\par
$${DV_t}= \beta_0 +\beta_1X_{t-1} +\beta_2DV_{t-1} +\mu_{i} $$
Where ${DV_t}$ is one type of harassment, $X_{t-1}$ is another type of harassment 
at a time before $t$, and ${DV_{t-1}}$ is the dependent variable at a prior time.\par
I will run this equation with a few different iterations to see if there is a correlation
among the different types of harassment. 


# Discussion
While these maps do demonstrate that there exists some sort of spatial relation
among type of sexual harassment, there is not enough information on the physical
enviornment of New Delhi. What type of spaces are these harassment incidents occuring 
in? Are these places shopping malls, tourist destinations, industrial zones, 
business districts, parks, or slum markets? How does the type of space affect 
the variation of sexual harassment? And do how these places are used also affect
the variation of sexual harassment? As shown from the criminology literature, 
time also plays a role on the occurance of crime. Therefore, how are these spaces 
occupied and used throughout the course of the day? Do these compositions change 
and therefore change the variation of type of sexual harassment? To answer these
questions, I would need more information on different spaces. \par


# Conclusion

Moving forward, there are two main directions this project would like to explore.
First, this research question would like to ask, is there a relationship between
the build enviornment of a place and sexual harassment? Previous research 
in the field of criminology have looked at build factors such as building heights
[@newman_defensible_1972;  @engert_spatial_1980; @rubenstein_link_19811), vegetation [@kuo_environment_2001;  @michael_effects_1994; @shaffer_perceptions_1985), lighting [@painter_influence_nodate; @farrington_improved_2002], open spaces [@taylor_crime_2002] and their relationship to crime rates and types of crime. My research would like to add to this field by looking at the different 
behaviors of sexual harassment and its build enviornment. The lack vigilance, 
as @jacobs_death_2011 points out can be a driver of crime. Taking this point further
to sexual harassment, where this umbrella crime can emcompass close vicinity 
interactions (touch) or distant interactions (stare), I would like to research
how the build enviorment contributes to the type of sexual harassment. Do more
crowded spaces experience higher physical sexual harassment? Do bigger squares 
see higher prevalence of verbal and non-direct harassment because of the distance
avaliable? Do areas of higher traffick lead to more sexual harassment? Does the 
type of market and the physical composition of the markets affect sexual harassment?
To tackle these questions, I would need data on the build enviornment. \par
The second direction this project leads to is through on the ground quantitative 
data on people's perceptions. This paper has shown that the way space used by 
people may affect certain behaviors. Therefore, usage of space is influenced by 
perception of space and safety. Therefore it would be beneficial to do on the 
ground mapping projects to better understand how people think about space, rights
to space, ownership of space and of bodies, and what they would like to see change.\par
