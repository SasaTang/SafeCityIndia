This paper will use geospatial sexual harassment incident data from [Safecity](http://safecity.in), a nonprofit with an online platform that maps out sexual harassment using crowd sourced pin locations in India to examine the relationship between different types of sexual harassment in public spaces. This paper looks into the relationship between five main categories of sexual harassment: non-direct, direct verbal, physical, stalking, and others.
